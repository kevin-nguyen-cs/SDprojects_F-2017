SIDE NOTE - If you want to use Linux and SSH into the CS Machines with Windows or Mac then download
            and install xming, winscp, and putty. Winscp will enable a direct SSH interface into the 
            CS Machines so you can use their linux environment. Putty can run directly from WINSCP 
            to enable command line programming. Xming will allow the user to access physical devices
            from across the network (such as accessing NetBeans or other programs). Xming is a slow
            program! Download links are below.
