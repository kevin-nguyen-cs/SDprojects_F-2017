#Put any notes here about Project 3.

SIDE NOTE - If you want to use Linux and SSH into the CS Machines with Windows or Mac then download
            and install xming, winscp, and putty. Winscp will enable a direct SSH interface into the 
            CS Machines so you can use their linux environment. Putty can run directly from WINSCP 
            to enable command line programming. Xming will allow the user to access physical devices
            from across the network (such as accessing NetBeans or other programs). Xming is a slow
            program! Download links are below.
            
            https://winscp.net/eng/download.php (To download both WINSCP and PUTTY)
            https://sourceforge.net/projects/xming/ (To download Xming)
            
            
SETTING CLASSPATHS (Linux) - To set the classpath, you must use "export CLASSPATH=.:/<your directory/<location of file/folder.."
                             However, due to the way the projects are set up, you must be in the top level directory of where
                             the program runs. You must be in, for example, the P2 folder to use the command line. You must not
                             be in any sub-folder or parent-folder other than the top level project folder when running the program.
                             You must also insert any missing files directly into the top level directory in order for the terminal
                             to recognize it (such as .vpl.pl schemas). There is a solution without this hassle, but this method
                             is the simple version (idea orginally from Dr. Batory).
                             
                             --> /u/someone/Desktop/P3Shell/<list of files for P3>
                             --> You must be in "P3Shell" folder after setting the classpath to use the command line
                             --> Any additional files place into "P3Shell" directly (if required)
